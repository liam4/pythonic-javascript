Todo.. :)

This document assumes you have a perfect browser that generally supports all of ES6. That SHOULD be every browser, as ECMAScript2015/ES6 is the current standard, but for now unfortunately not all browsers implement everything. I personally always use the somewhat glitchy browsers [Google Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) and [Firefox Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/)/[Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/). [Node.js 5](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v5.0.0/) is also pretty good with ES6, and you can always use transpilers such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) or [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler).
